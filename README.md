# Root Code Challenge

_Clean code is key_

Track driver history with `Node.js` / `JavaScript`.

Follow along with the boilerplate workshop to make your own! This canonical
version can serve as a reference, or a starting point. For an in depth
discussion into the code that makes up this repository, see the
[Boilermaker Guided Tour][process-node]

## Setup

To use this as boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

* Don't fork or clone this repo! Instead, create a new, empty
  directory on your machine and `git init` (or create an empty repo on
  Github and clone it to your local machine)
* Run the following commands:

```
git remote add boilermaker https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/boilermaker.git
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

Why did we do that? Because every once in a while, `boilermaker` may
be updated with additional features or bug fixes, and you can easily
get those changes from now on by entering:

```
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```
